			<h2> Job Apocolypse </h2>
			<h3> By Maria Salamone</h3>
				<img src=" https://i2.wp.com/markamaza.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/robot-job-takeover-unemployment.jpg?fit=640%2C396&ssl=1" id="pic1">
				<p> The videos main argument is about how the state of technology is advancing so much that many human held jobs can be replaced by a robot or AI. That technoloy will take over jobs making production  easier, faster, safer, and more efficent. That robots can change society as factory owners wont have to pay the robots, insurence companys will get the payments and less accidents that are caused by human drivers. That robots wont ever tire out and work will never be stalled or halted as robots never get tired and can got hrough work non-stop without any breaks. That many peoples will be replaced due to the embending groth of technoly making human work null with which only increase the unemployment rates that is going on all over. 
				</p>

				<p> I agree with the statements the video is making that the advancements of technology is going to take over jobs. Many advancements are proving the effiency of robots in jobs making replacing humans with robot workers can be more profet for the company. although, many jobs may be taken over by robots other jobs such as being a surgeon or director need a human touch becauseeven though robots might make the jobs easier and fastr they can still make mistakes during important parts of the job.

					<p> Footprints and Fingerprints</p>
					<p> That people are leaving Footprints and fingerprints some visible some invidible throughout the internet. That theres always a trace being left behind in a persons history and on their internet. That our internet keeps the history of what we've been on and tracks our previous prints that we left in place after being on the internet.</p>
					<p> Knowing Where You Are</p>
					<p> This article explains how the GPS has been very helpful in the lives of people who dont want to ask for directions, or need evidence for mileage, etc. That GPS or Global Position system has created directional awareness and help with its software for multiple purposes in a persons daily life. </p>
					<p> The Parking Garage Knows More Than You Think</p>
					<p> This article goes into the security of garages and their systems. That the garages take pictures of the cars entering and print out the recept for later wiht the cars lisense plate. If the recpt is wrong the car is unable to be let back out as a security mechanism to prevent theift.</p>
					<p> Each of the articles show how technology has a sysytem to help and watch over history. Technolgy is advanced theres no denying that but tech does alot of history storage and following it always knows what you've done and saves that information, improving off of it.</p>

			 		<h3> Aesthetically pleasing, great job!</h3>
			 		<h4> Tsering Dhondup</h4>
			 		<h5> First of all, I have to say, you did a fantastic job with the visuals, everything about this site is gorgeous! This is incredible compared to mine and the other two I have seen, now I will proceed to see the contents of what you wrote. The interview looks fairly bland unfortunately, I don't like the way it looks in comparison to the rest of the website, you know what I mean. Don't appreciate the typo after asking about whether he believed technology hurt or helped society. Minor nitpick, that's all. Wait, never mind, I see that for the othr posts. Damn it. There isn't much for me to comment on in terms of the content of the interview. But nice visuals!</h5>
